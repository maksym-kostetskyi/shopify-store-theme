Project Overview
This project enhances a custom Shopify theme by adding dynamic features to the product page, improving the user experience. The key goals were to upgrade the image gallery and implement image filtering.

Key Improvements
1. Swiper Gallery (Product Gallery)
Integrated Swiper.js to create a flexible, highly configurable image gallery.

Allows a store admin to customize settings via the theme's schema for different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile):

Number of slides shown

Pagination (on/off)

Navigation arrows (on/off)

Space between slides

2. Photo Filtering by Color Variant
Implemented a feature that automatically displays only the images corresponding to the selected product color variant.

This functionality works without a page reload, providing an instant and seamless user experience.

Each color variant has 3-4 associated photos to provide a comprehensive view of the product.

Technologies Used
Liquid: Shopify's templating language.

Swiper.js: A modern JavaScript slider library.

JavaScript: For dynamic, client-side functionality.

HTML/CSS: For structure and styling.
